            <h4>Who I am</h4>
            <p>Hey! My name is Simon, as you may noticed.<br>
                I'm a 16 year old hobby photographer from Austria, more precisely from Upper Austria.<br><br>
                About two years ago, I graduarted from secondary school. At this point I had to make a desicion. Should I start working or should I attend a Higher Technical Institute?
                I chose the Higher Technical Institute for media technology. I had previously been interested in filming and taking pictures, so I thought it would be right for me.<br>
                When I had the subject "photography" the first time, I knew it was the right decision! I really learned many things about cameras and settings in the first year. It was very interesting and fun, so I wanted to have my own camera. <br>
                I only had a limited budget, because I was a student, as you know. I researched for a long time and finally came to the conclusion that the Panasonic Lumix GX80 would be the best choice for me. I bought this camera in a bondle with a 14-140mm f3.5-5.6 lens.<br>
                I really startet to love photography and filmmaking when I finally got this camera. I love this combination of camera and lens (maybe because I could not try many other cameras or lenses).<br><br>
                Now, about one year later, I still have the same camera and the same lens. I use almost every free minute to take pictures and film.
